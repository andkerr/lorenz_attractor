This script implements a CLI that lets users specify inital conditions for up to
five simultaneous [Lorenz Attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system),
and generates a corresponding animation of their motion.

Inspired by
[Quantitative Bytes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiQVEoqrJNiVBWAcknaJLnQ),
and created with Pygame.

First install required packages:

```
pip -r install requirements.txt
```

```
